# sustainable-food-nexus
This is a team project I did recently for a competition, where we were tasked to do an analysis on food sustainability.

Our main tools were Orange and also Visual Studio Code with a Jupyter Notebook extension. Our main goal was to create a relation from 2 problem statements which are Food Loss and also Greenhouse Gas Emission, with our solution being reducing both of them. We started off with typical preprocessing and data preparation steps, and we began doing clustering to find other countries that have the same agricultural characteristics with Malaysia. We then proceeded our comparison with this cluster, doing multiple visualizations to fully understand where Malaysia stand in the cluster, to see the types of produce Malaysia has, studying our mean emission by types(C02, CH4, N20), taking a deeper look at our main food loss contributors, and see the percentage of food loss by crops(Malaysia's main crops produce) . We proceeded with Orange to create a predictive model taking into account Malaysia's main crops produce and changing the production level while observing the future effects towards GHG emission and also foodloss.
